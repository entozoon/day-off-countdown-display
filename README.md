# Day Off Countdown Display

![Day Off Countdown Display](/posterity/day-off-countdown.jpg)

Personal project, querying a Google Calendar to reveal the nearest upcoming event entitled 'Myke day off' or similar. The Google functions API stuff is not public, for obvious reasons, but this repo contains the visual display code (`/src/main.cpp`) and 3D print designs for the case (`/hardware`).
